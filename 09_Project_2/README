                            Working features

* perform a search via ioctl() (OFS_PID, OFS_UID, OFS_OWNER and OFS_NAME)
* read any number of results via read()
  read can be called multiple times until all results have been read
  a new search can be performed any time
* locking on task_struct
* RCU locking on cred, files_struct, fdtable and file 

Building
--------
* make clean
* make all

Header file for user programs
-----------------------------
(constants for ioctl() commands and struct ofs_result)
openFileSearch.h


                             Implementation

open
====
The implementation cannot be used concurrently by multiple threads due to the
usage of static variables and missing synchronization. Therefore open checks
whether the device is already in use and fails with -EBUSY if so. Any search of
a previous user is discarded.
As the array for the results is likely to be required multiple times and can be
reused for multiple searches it is allocated in open.

release
=======
The memory allocated for storing the results is freed and the device_opened_
flag is cleared so opening the device is permitted again.

ioctl
=====
Depending on the ioctl() command the search request is dispatched to an
appropriate method. If an invaild ioctl() command is provided the call fails
with -EINVAL.

OFS_PID
-------
For this case *all* open files of a *single* task are queried. The struct
task_struct is requested for the provided PID. The request fails in case of an
non existing PID which is indicated by returning -EINVAL. The actual search is
performed in ofs_search() which is called with the found struct task_struct and
a filter matching all results.

ofs_search() traverses the open files of a single task converting each into an
struct ofs_result and applying a filter to it. Results matching the filter
criteria are added at the end of the result array all others are discarded. If
the maximum number of results is reached the traversation is stopped.

OFS_UID, OFS_OWNER and OFS_NAME
-------------------------------
For this case the search basis are *all* open files of *all* tasks. But only
files matching certain criteria (equal UID, owner or name) should be included
in the results. open_search_all()

First idea: The init task (PID 1) is the root of the process tree and is used
as entry point to perform a depth-search on the process tree (init_task is
exported by the kernel and task_struct contains a list of children).

BUT: Kernel stack limited -> recursions should be avoided

task_struct has another list called 'tasks' which is a list of all tasks.
Used by the macro for_each_process()
-> iteration instead of recursion in ofs_search_all()

read
====
After a search has been performed read() can be called multiple times until no
more results are available. Due to the fact that ofs_search() stops inserting
when reaching the array capacity read() can rely on read_count_.

Example:
10 elements have been found during search
read is called each time with a buffer of size 3

| read() call | filled in buffer              | return |
|-------------|-------------------------------|--------|
| 1           | results #1-3                  | 3      |
| 2           | results #4-6                  | 3      |
| 3           | results #7-9                  | 3      |
| 4           | result #10                    | 1      |
| 5           | -                             | 0      |
|             | no more results are available | 0      |
|             | clear search_performed_ flag  |        |
| 6           | -                             | -ESRCH |
|             | no search has been performed  |        |
|             | yet                           |        |

                               Known bugs

* Not a real bug but a special behaviour for handling too long filenames:
  Especially the paths of system.journal, user-<UID>.journal and
  user@<UID>.service are much longer than 64 characters. In the results these
  names will be shortened e.g. ".../system.journal"
  Searching by name can also be performed by using the .../ prefix.
